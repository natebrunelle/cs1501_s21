# Logistics

## Meetings

Live zoom lectures will be held Wednesdays at 3pm.

Attending lecture or viewing a recording is expected. Attending workshops or viewing a recording is optional but recommended. Recordings of lectures and workshops are provided on the [schedule page](schedule.html) (click for more information under the appropriate date).

## Readings

There is no required textbook for this class. There will be assigned readings attached to each lecture that will provide context and some interesting information about each lecture. You can find these linked under each lecture's tab on the "schedule" page. It is recommended that you read these before you come to class as they are usually good resources for understanding, however they are optional.

## Lectures

Lectures will be held via [Zoom](https://virginia.zoom.us/my/ibrahimhamdy). Additionally, you can click on the "Online Meetings" tab on Collab to find the link.

## Course Components {#tasks}

- **Lectures**: This will be an entirely lecture-based course. We will meet at the scheduled time via zoom, where we’ll discuss the topic of that day’s lecture. Attendance for lectures is mandatory, and each lecture you show up to will be worth 4 points for a maximum of 48 points.
- **Quizzes**: Each week, you will have one quiz to test your understanding of the material covered in the lecture, and give you an opportunity to ask questions of your own that you feel were not answered in lecture. These quizzes will be open-note and open-internet, but must be taken individually. You are not allowed to work with other people on these quizzes and doing so is an honor violation. Additionally, all resources on the internet must be pre-existing, you are not allowed to post questions on message boards or other websites for help. They really should be easy enough that it shouldn't be necessary. There will be 14 quizzes in total with the lowest 4 dropped. Each quiz will be worth 4 points for a maximum of 40 points of your grade. Quizzes will be due every week at 2:55pm on Wednesdays right before class.
- **Final Exam**: The final exam will be worth 12 points and will be taken during the allotted time slot (TBA). Because this class is pass/fail, if you have enough points to pass the class without taking the exam, you don't have to show up. The final exam will be open-note, open-internet, and individual, same as the quizzes. It isn't really meant to be a "final" per se, it's more just another short quiz and a space where you can chat and destress from exams. I want this class to be helpful and fun, not stressful.



# Grading

| Description | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Attendance  | 48 |
| Quizzes | 40 |
| Final Exam | 12 |

## Deadlines

The deadline for each quiz is at 2:55pm on the Wednesday after the quiz is released. Quizzes will also be released each Wednesday directly after lecture.

Late submissions will be accepted up to three days past the due date for a penalty of 1 point for every 24 hours after the deadline. If outside circumstances prevent you from turning in a quiz or create other complications, please let me know and I can help work with you. There are also quite a few quizzes dropped from your grade to pad out accidentally missed quizzes and incorrect questions.

## Returned Grades and Regrades

Alas, I am only a man, and I will probably make mistakes in my grading. If you feel like you want something to be regraded, please send me an email with the quiz number and your reasoning for why you want a regrade.

Additionally, I am only one person, meaning it could take a few days (or more) to finish grading each week's quizzes. I apologize if the grading is slow, but I promise I will get everything in as early as I can!

# Miscellanea

## Personal accommodations

### Special Circumstances

The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you
require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center
(SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or
to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting [their website](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac).
For this course, we ask that students with special circumstances let us know as soon as possible, preferably
during the **first week of class**.

### Religious observances

 It is the University’s long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely
held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing to
Prof. Brunelle as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about
academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs,contact the [University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR)](https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu
or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of
the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.

### Safe Environment

The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning
environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University
hold as critically important:

1. Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
1. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.

If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can
be found on the [UVA Sexual Violence website](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence) that describes reporting options and resources available.
As your professor and a human, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand
ready to provide support and resources as we can. As a faculty member, I am responsible employee,
which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the
University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student
receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to
determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University
community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are [Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds](https://eocr.virginia.edu/chart-confidential-resources). The worst possible
situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able
to help.

### Life

Bad things happen.
People forget things and make mistakes.
Bad days coincide with due dates.
Etc.

If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, come talk to me and we'll resolve the situation as best we can.

If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here
who are ready and wanting to help. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend
crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and
confidentially over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.
