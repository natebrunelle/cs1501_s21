# Course Overview 

The goal of this course is to provide a deeper understanding of the field of Computer Science and the different career paths possible. In particular, we will take a look at the following topics:

- How we store, understand, and manipulate data to our advantage
- Functions, implementations, and how the tools we use affect what we can do
- Binary Logic and Circuits
- Algorithms and techniques we can use to become better programmers
- Computer networks and the internet
- Cybersecurity and cryptography
- Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and artificial general intelligence
- Genes and bioinformatics

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will have:

- Covered different topics that you will learn in other cs courses in a brief and interesting way
- Discuss the theory behind computer science, the more abstract concepts, and give a more in-depth understanding of what computer science is and what the field aims to achieve
- Look at different disciplines, career paths, cutting edge research and advancements in the field
- Provide an overall better understanding of the computer science field as a whole and what the field is capable of
- Become more prepared for the CS curriculum and have a better understanding of the CS field both in industry and academia



## Eligibility

You should take this course if you've taken CS 1110 or have some similar level of knowledge about computer programming. You can take this course without having programmed before as there will be very little code in this course, and you will not have to write code yourself, however understanding how to read and write basic code makes understanding some course concepts easier.


## Course Structure

You will see the following components in this course this semester. Look in the syllabus for the details on each:

- **Lectures**: Introduces and explains all topics in the course. This is the primary component of the course
- **Quizzes**: Individual work to evaluate your fluency and understanding of each of the course concepts
- **Weekly Meetings**: We will have weekly meetings on Fridays (time TBA) to discuss concepts brought up during that week's lecture and answer questions. These meetings are completely optional

## Other Notes

### Online Logistics
As many of you have probably guessed, this class will be taught entirely online. Because of this and the many problems that come with it, I will be doing my best to help everyone get accomodated, so if you have any issues with this course or any others, feel free to talk to me about them! I'm here to help you! I will be posting all lectures to the course webpage and onto Collab, so if you have to miss a lecture it isn't a huge deal. If something keeps you from turning in an assignment on time or attending a lecture, email me and we can work it out. Additionally, I think [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck) is super helpful if you're struggling with online learning. 

### Instructor Warning
This is my first time teaching this course, so if things don't go well at first, please forgive me. I've never tried something like this before

### Friday Meetings
We will also be meeting on Fridays (time TBA) to just discuss the topics covered in lecture and on the homeworks that week. This is where I can help with homeworks and answer questions about the topics covered. I will also do my best to provide career advice, or at least point you towards resources that can give better advice than me. The purpose of this class is really just to help you, and I want to make these meetings very unstructured and open so that I can answer any questions you have.
